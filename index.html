        <p>
            There are many situations in which first aid training can save lives: After all, there is a reason that many
            professions require their workforce to have first aid certificates & CPR training, such as police officers,
            firefighters, flight attendants and even teachers.
        </p>
        <img src="/first-aid/first-aid-sign.jpg" alt="First Aid sign">
        <p>
            Even if your profession doesn't specifically require you to be first aid trained, the qualification
            can improve your employability: Employers in Australia have an obligation to have first-aid officers
            available for their workforce.
        </p>
        <p>
            Generally speaking, workplaces are categorised as low-risk, high risk and remote high risk. Low risk are
            workplaces such as offices, high risk are construction sites and remote high risk workplaces such as mines.
        </p>
        <p>
            Low risk environments require one first-aid officer for every 50 workers, high risk environments require one
            first aid officer per 25 workers, and remote high risk envrionment require a first aid officer for every 10
            employeess.
